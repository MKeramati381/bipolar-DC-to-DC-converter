This model represents a bipolar DC-to-DC converter, designed for bidirectional power flow. It likely uses a full-bridge topology, enabling efficient voltage conversion in both directions. Bipolar converters are commonly used in systems requiring energy exchange, such as battery charging and discharging, energy storage systems, and renewable energy integration. The model may include control strategies like PWM to manage power flow and ensure stable operation across varying conditions.
